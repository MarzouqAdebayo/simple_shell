/**
 * _read_fn - Read a line of input from standard input.
 *
 * Return: A pointer to the read line (including the newline character),
 *         or NULL on failure or end of file.
 *
 * This function reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin).
 * It dynamically allocates memory to store the input line and automatically
 * resizes it as needed.
 * The function returns a pointer to the read line, including the newline
 * character at the end. If an error occurs or the end of file is reached,
 * it returns NULL and may exit the program with an error code.
